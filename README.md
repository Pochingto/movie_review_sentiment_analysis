The notebook is run under the google colab environment.

If you want to run the notebook, please note that:
1) run from top to bottom
2) change the file path of the data(e.g. train.csv, test.csv)
3) specify a cuda:0 environment, or change the "device"
4) I have read word.csv during the "word embedding" section which is also attached in this zip. If you want to run the "word embedding" section, please also note that you have to read the "word.csv".
5) I keep print the model architecture of the baseline RNN(just because I use the same variable name for all the model at the beginning), you can change it if you want.
